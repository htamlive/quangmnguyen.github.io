					<p></p>
					<p>FoodFeed is our Mobile Development course's final project, born from the realization that Vietnam boasts numerous delightful sidewalk restaurants. These hidden gems, cherished by locals, often remain undiscovered by those from other areas. Motivated by this, my team and I set out to create an app facilitating the sharing of dining experiences. We aim to bridge the gap between locals and newcomers, making it easier for everyone to explore and contribute to developing local street food culture.</p>
					<p>In this project, I take on the responsibilities of project manager and front-end leader. Building such an extensive system is a novel experience for us. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of integrating <strong>Kotlin, Java, Jetpack Compose, and XML</strong>. Handling API calls and managing waiting times posed challenges, but they were intellectually stimulating. Moreover, while assisting in resolving backend bugs, I had the chance to broaden my knowledge of the backend, especially Django. </p>
					<p>Despite the time conflicts that arose during our exchange programs and home university studies, the four members of our team worked cohesively. We managed to overcome these challenges, maintaining effective communication and working efficiently to complete the project on time. I am genuinely proud of the dedication and collaboration demonstrated by each member of our team.</p>

					<p>MyThorch is a revolutionary document interaction app that leverages user behavior to embed vectors and store them in a Redis vector database. This process creates a long-term memory AI that truly understands the user's needs and preferences, leading to a highly efficient reading experience.</p>
					<p>Our team joined the OpenAI hack stack event organized by lablab.ai, during which GPT-3 and chatGPT gained widespread recognition. As GPT-3 APIs became available around the same time, we decided to dive into a project utilizing this technology. GPT-3 excels in summarizing and rephrasing content, leading us to develop an application that could personalize documents for readers. Our aim was to take a substantial step towards facilitating personalized learning experiences, allowing individuals to engage with content in their preferred manner</p>
					<p>I serve as both the project manager and backend developer in this project, overseeing tasks such as organizing meetings, conceptualizing ideas, developing business models, and creating APIs. One of the most challenging aspects has been designing a method to modify document content while ensuring its continued relevance. Additionally, we needed to monitor user behavior and status for timely updates, requiring considerable effort to find effective solutions. Despite the daunting nature of these challenges, the collective determination of the team prevailed, providing me with the opportunity to lead the design of the backend system.</p>
					<p>My team and I achieved a spot among the top 8 finalists in our first international competition, marking a notable accomplishment given the competition's size with over 7 thousand participants. While the result is certainly positive, it prompts a closer examination of the project's efficiency. Despite being a personal favorite, it seems that additional research is required, as the success in this competition hasn't translated to other submissions. Despite setbacks in subsequent attempts, my enthusiasm for this project remains strong, driven by its potential to positively impact individuals navigating the world of AI technology.</p>

					<p>A recyclable trash detection app, with monetized incentives to encourage recycling.</p>
					<p>I were in the role of project manager this time.</p>
					<p>This marked one of the most challenging instances I've faced while brainstorming ideas for the team. In the initial moments of our participation in this competition, the topic was unveiled right after the celebratory kickoff of the hackathon, centering around building an application related to the environment. Drawing from past experiences, we recognized the difficulty inherent in this topic, as creating tools to interact with the outside world often involves hardware components. Additionally, the prospect of establishing collaboration with environmental companies to ensure the app's sustainability presented another formidable challenge. In response, we opted to study successful apps, aiming to understand and articulate the reasons behind their enduring success.</p>
					<p>Eventually, we embraced the business model employed by Uprace, an app designed to foster running habits, as inspiration for our own project. Our application focused on helping individuals cultivate 'green' habits through trash classification. Users earned scores and received coupons for each picture of their properly sorted trash. To strengthen our proposition, we highlighted upcoming legislation in Vietnam, which threatened severe penalties for those neglecting trash classification. By positioning our app as a means to avoid such penalties, we aimed to secure its success and provide a platform for advertising environmental products. To handle trash classification temporarily, we integrated a pre-trained object classification model into the app.</p>
					<p>Although the app wasn't fully completed, we successfully conducted the demonstration and presentation, ultimately securing the third prize in this highly competitive competition featuring 200 teams from various universities across the country. Throughout the competition, I honed my skills in coordinating team members and devised strategies to navigate high-pressure situations, ensuring we persevered until the end despite the incompleteness of the final result. This experience marked a significant achievement, and despite the challenges, I'm immensely proud of what we learned and accomplished as a team.</p>

					<p>Everlast is an online application designed to assist individuals coping with chronic illness in managing end-of-life logistics, while concurrently serving as a digital memorial where loved ones can contribute (conceptual).</p>
					<p>This is my first time participating in a hackathon. Throughout this one-day competition, I took on the role of project manager despite having zero prior experience in this position.</p>
					<p>The experience was both thrilling and challenging, considering that we were all novices in this domain. Determined to stand out, we embarked on brainstorming a distinctive product. The chosen topic was 'happiness,' a broad subject. Our focus shifted to the loneliness experienced by individuals near the end of their lives. Many of them find themselves isolated from others, including their families, due to societal stereotypes that can perplex them.</p>
					<p>Driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact, we set out to create an app that becomes a supportive companion for individuals as they approach the inevitable. Our app goes beyond conventional boundaries, offering valuable insights and practical information on preparing for one's funeral. But that's not all - it's a platform for people to share their deepest desires through a bucket list and send heartfelt encouragement to the next generations. In essence, our app is more than just an application; it's a heartfelt journey toward ensuring that every individual's final moments are met with dignity and personal fulfillment.</p>
					<p>In my perspective, the idea initially felt quite unconventional and abstract. Surprisingly, we not only secured the third prize but also earned praise from a business owner for introducing innovative resources with potential targets. Despite our limited experience, the plan was a bit shaky initially, but we successfully brought to life a comprehensive app complete with a solid business model.</p>
					<p>This hackathon was an invaluable learning experience, providing insights into creating the most viable product. It served as a cornerstone in developing my leadership and management skills. It shows that even when starting from scratch, unconventional ideas can lead to impressive outcomes and unexpected commendations.</p>
